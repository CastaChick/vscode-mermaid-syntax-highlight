## Initial Idea

Based on the starter language support repo [here](https://github.com/mjbvz/vscode-fenced-code-block-grammar-injection-example), and initially created based on the Atom language support [here](https://github.com/ytisf/language-mermaid).

## TODO

- [ ] Publish to VS Marketplace
- [ ] Determine remaining missing syntax issues
- [ ] Add sequenceDiagram support
